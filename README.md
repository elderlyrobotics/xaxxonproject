# Xaxxon Project

Robotics Research Co-op - SFU Experimental Robotics Laboratory  
• Renovated an Oculus Prime Robot with a 3-D printed platform to hold a tablet with Skype  
• Controlled the platform through a web application to turn up, down, left, or right using servos with encoders  
• Programmed in HTML, JS, jQuery, and Bootstrap to create the web application  
• Created a Node.js server which enabled sending serial input commands to a customized Arduino  
• Used AJAX to send GET requests from the web application to the Node.js server and the Node.js server  
catches the GET requests which then runs functions that send serial input commands to the Arduino  

Please refer to the manuals part 1, 2, and 3 to re-create the platform:

Please refer to the user manual to use the platform:
